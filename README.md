# Grid-Game
[Y2S2] Gameplay Programming - Assignment 1: Grid Based Game 

This assignment tasked us with following a set of requirements to create a game in which the player can move around a grid, avoiding enemies that move vertically along the Y axis. We were also asked to add out own features, not listed in the requirements of the game.

I chose to add an objective to the game, in the form of a crown that the player must reach, and to draw the game board. The player was also given a limited number of moves, in order to add a level of difficulty.

More detail can be found in the design doc
